# Automatic Code Commenting with OpenAI

This simple python program can automatically create python docstrings for any python file.
This goes through an entire directory (including subdirectories) and creates AI generated docstrings for all functions and methods.

With the docstrings, you can use it to generate formal documentation using Sphinx.

Some future features:
- Automatically create Sphinx documentation
- Create comments for Java (javadocs) and other languages
